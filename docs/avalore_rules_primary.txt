Avalore Combat System Simulator Overview
This document outlines the Avalore RPG mechanics and provides guidance for implementing a Python-based simulator focusing on backend logic. It covers character stats, combat rules, weapons/armor, feats, and magic. All information is drawn from the Avalore mechanics reference[1][2] to ensure accuracy.
Character Stats and Skills
Each Avalore character has four core Stats: Dexterity, Intelligence, Harmony, Strength[1]. These represent broad attributes: - Dexterity (DEX): Agility, reflexes, and coordination. - Intelligence (INT): Reasoning, knowledge, and perception. - Harmony (HAR): Spiritual attunement and charisma (also fuels magic, see Arcane). - Strength (STR): Physical power and endurance.
All new characters start with 0 in each stat (stats can range from -3 to +3)[1]. Each stat has three associated skills that start at 0 and can range from -3 to +3 as well[3]. The skills represent specialized proficiencies: - DEX Skills: Acrobatics, Stealth, Finesse (e.g. agility maneuvers, sneaking, fine manipulation). - INT Skills: Healing, Perception, Research (e.g. first aid, noticing details, knowledge gathering). - HAR Skills: Arcana, Nature, Belief (e.g. magic lore, survival/animal handling, faith/willpower). - STR Skills: Fortitude, Athletics, Forging (e.g. endurance, physical feats, crafting metalwork).
Skill Checks: To perform an action requiring a stat/skill (e.g. a perception check or acrobatic stunt), Avalore uses a 2d10 roll plus the relevant stat and skill modifiers[4]. This sum is compared to a standard difficulty (DC) of 12 in most cases[5]. For example, if a character has Dexterity = -1 and Acrobatics = +2, an Acrobatics check roll would be 2d10 + (-1+2) = 2d10 + 1[4]. Rolling a total of 12 or higher generally means success. Skills may also be used in opposed contests (one character’s roll against another’s).
Experience and Improvement: Characters gain experience points (XP) through play. XP is spent to raise stats, improve skills, or gain new feats (special abilities). While specifics of progression are beyond the scope of this simulator, note that Avalore’s progression system ties XP to improvements in stats/skills and even to learning magic (mages sacrifice XP and feats to gain higher Anima pools – see Arcane)[6][7].
Health (HP): All characters have 20 hit points (HP) by default[8]. HP abstractly represents a character’s stamina, endurance, and luck in avoiding fatal blows. When HP drops to 0, the character becomes Critical (downed and bleeding out)[9]. At 0 HP: - The character is incapacitated (“on the brink”) but not instantly dead[9]. - Any further damage or strenuous action triggers a Death Save roll[10]. - Death Saves: A death save is a special 2d10 roll to determine if the dying character succumbs. After any damaging hit on a Critical character (or if the downed character attempts an action), the character rolls /roll death[10]. The exact mechanics aren’t fully detailed in our sources, but it’s implied that a failed death save means the character dies, whereas success allows clinging to life a bit longer. (In Avalore, certain feats or effects can interact with death saves – e.g. a dual strike counts as one attack for the purpose of triggering death saves[11].)
Action Economy and Combat Turn Structure
Avalore combat is turn-based. In each turn, a character can perform a limited number of actions before the next character acts. The system distinguishes between full actions and limited actions: - Full Actions: Standard actions like attacking, evading, blocking, using an item, or moving. By default, a character has 2 actions per turn to spend. Some heavy attacks or complex actions may consume 2 actions at once (taking the whole turn). - Limited Actions: Minor or bonus actions that are “free” or extra on top of full actions (at most one limited action per turn). Certain feats grant special maneuvers as limited actions. For example, a feat might let you make an extra unarmed strike as a limited action[12]. Limited actions cannot usually be used for normal attacks unless a feat specifies it. They provide flexibility for small additional moves.
Movement: Moving a short distance likely consumes one full action (e.g. to move your speed). “Dashing” to move farther would use both actions. Heavy armor reduces movement speed (see Armor section). For simplicity, the simulator can assume a default move distance (e.g. 5 meters or Minecraft blocks per action) and double that for a dash. Heavy armor applies a -1 penalty to all movement actions[13] (meaning one less block or unit of distance per move action). Movement and positioning might be abstracted in the simulator, but it’s important for range calculations.
Distance and Range: Avalore divides weapons and spell ranges into three bands: - Melee: Hand-to-hand distance (adjacent). - Skirmishing: Short-range (thrown weapons, reach weapons, roughly a few meters). - Ranged: Long-range (bows, crossbows, spells, tens of meters).
Weapons are categorized by these ranges. Some actions (like opportunity attacks or certain spells) depend on range categories. For instance, most Skirmishing and Ranged weapons cannot be used underwater, with a few specific exceptions (wands, javelins, spellbooks, and crossbows still function underwater)[14]. For the simulator, range can be a property of weapons, and you can enforce simple rules (e.g. underwater environment disables certain weapon attacks unless exempt).
Turn Order: Initiative is not detailed in the source, but a simple Dexterity-based roll or alternating turns can be used. For now, assume an alternating turn structure for two characters.
Attack Resolution and Evasion Mechanics
When a character uses an Attack action, follow these steps: 1. Choose Weapon & Target: The attacker selects an equipped weapon (or unarmed strike) and a target in range. 2. Attack Roll (Aim Roll): The attacker makes a roll to hit: roll 2d10 and add any attack modifiers. Attack modifiers can come from the weapon’s accuracy, the attacker’s stats/skills, or situational bonuses/penalties. By default, melee attacks might add Strength or Dexterity mods at GM’s discretion, and ranged attacks might add Dexterity. (Avalore doesn’t list specific ability-to-hit ties, but using stat+skill for attacks is logical. For example, a precise thrust could add DEX+Finesse, while a heavy swing might add STR+Athletics. The system is somewhat simplified, as many weapons just give flat bonuses – see Weapons section.) 3. Base Difficulty: If the target is not actively evading, compare the attack roll to DC 12 (standard success threshold)[5]. Rolling 12 or higher means the attack would hit the target[5], whereas below 12 means a miss. For example, an attacker with a +1 weapon bonus needs to roll 11 or higher on 2d10 to succeed (because 11 + 1 = 12).
Active Evasion: If the target used an Evade action on their last turn, then contested evasion rules apply instead of the fixed DC:
The attacker still makes the attack roll as above.
The defender triggers an Evasion roll: roll 2d10 and add their evasion modifiers. Evasion mod is typically DEX + Acrobatics skill, plus any armor/feat modifiers. (E.g. a DEX +1, Acrobatics +2 character has +3 evasion; heavy armor would penalize this by -2[15].)
Compare the evasion roll to the attack’s roll:
If the evasion roll is equal or higher than the attack roll, the attack is fully evaded, missing entirely[16] (no damage).
If the evasion roll is lower than the attack roll but is still a “success” (12+) on 2d10, the defender is grazed[17]. A grazing hit means the attack partially connects:
If the defender wears light or no armor, they take half damage (rounded up)[18] due to narrowly dodging the blow.
If the defender wears medium or heavy armor, normally a grazing evasion does not reduce damage – heavy armor users rely on armor rather than agility, so a “grazing” dodge still results in a solid hit (full damage). (Exception: certain magical effects can allow even heavy armor to turn a hit into a graze[18].)
If the evasion roll is below 12 (a failed evasion attempt), then the attack hits at full effect (the dodge was ineffective)[17]. Essentially, failing to get 12+ on the evasion roll means you didn’t avoid the blow at all.
Note: Using Evade costs one of the defender’s actions on their turn. Once activated, it lasts until their next turn, affecting all incoming attacks in that span[19]. However, it typically does not apply to certain special attacks like reaction attacks (e.g. a swift riposte might not trigger an evasion roll)[19].
Damage Roll/Application: If the attack hits (or grazes), determine damage:
Each weapon has a fixed damage value in Avalore’s system (instead of rolling damage dice). For example, an arming sword deals 4 damage on a hit[20], a sling deals 6 damage[21], etc. The simulator can use these fixed values for simplicity.
Armor Soak: Subtract the target’s armor protection from the damage:
Light armor reduces damage by 1d2-1 (0 to 1 point)[22].
Medium armor reduces damage by 1d3-1 (0 to 2 points)[23].
Heavy armor reduces damage by 1d3 (1 to 3 points)[24].
If an attack has the Armor-Piercing (AP) property, it ignores armor soak entirely. (See “Armor Piercing” below.)
Apply Damage: Deduct the remaining damage from the target’s HP. The simulator should track HP for both characters. If HP drops to 0, mark the character as Critical (downed). Optionally, implement death save rolls or simply note that the next hit could be fatal.
Armor-Piercing (AP) Attacks: Some special attacks or weapon types can pierce armor. For example, a feat allows an “armour-piercing strike” with certain weapons, which ignores the target’s armor (no soak roll)[25]. If the target has AP immunity, that special strike instead just does +1 extra damage without bypassing armor[25]. (By default, targets do not have AP immunity, but a Large Shield provides it when blocking[26] – see Shields.) The simulator’s data for a weapon or attack can include a boolean armor_piercing to handle this.
Special Defenses – Blocking with Shields: If the defender has a shield and used a Block action on their turn, they may negate hits instead of or in addition to evading:
A character who has taken the Block action raises their shield until their next turn. If an attack would hit them, they make a shield block roll (this is effectively a reaction roll).
Shield Block Roll: Roll 2d10 and apply the shield’s modifier:
A Small Shield has a -3 modifier, needing a high roll to block successfully[27].
A Large Shield has a -2 modifier (slightly easier to block)[26].
The block succeeds if 2d10 + shieldMod >= 12 (the target DC is 12 for blocking)[27]. On success, the shield absorbs all damage from that attack[28]. On failure, the attack strikes as normal (armor can still soak some damage if applicable).
Shields are more effective against arrows/bolts: Blocking a ranged attack grants a further +1 bonus to the shield roll[28]. (The simulator can add +1 if the incoming attack is categorized as ranged.)
A Large Shield also negates the Armor-Piercing property: when using a large shield, AP attacks are treated as normal (the shield doesn’t allow them to bypass defense)[26].
The shield block attempt is resolved after a hit is determined. If an evasion roll was also in effect, the defender would typically choose one method – but in Avalore, you could potentially have both: you evaded if possible, and if not, your shield can still save you. (This depends on how strictly the rules are layered. For coding simplicity, you might allow either an evasion roll or a shield roll, whichever the character had set up.)
Weapon and Shield: Using a shield usually occupies one hand, so typically only one-handed weapons can be used with a shield. Enforce equipment rules accordingly in character setup.
Example Attack Sequence: - Character A (attacker) swings a sword at Character B (defender). A has an arming sword (+1 to hit, 4 dmg) and rolls 2d10, getting a total of 13 after modifiers. - B did not evade this turn, so the attack hits (>=12)[5]. B is in medium armor, so damage will be reduced. - Damage 4 is rolled against medium armor soak 1d3-1. Suppose the soak roll comes out 2 (meaning 1d3-1 = 2). B’s armor absorbs 2, so B takes 2 damage and loses 2 HP. - Next round, B uses an Evade action. A attacks again with the same sword, rolling a 14. B rolls evasion (DEX+Acrobatics) and gets, say, 12. B’s evasion (12) is lower than A’s attack (14) but is a success (>=12), resulting in a grazing hit[17]. B’s light armor (or no armor, if say B had none) would then halve the damage. If B were in heavy armor, no halving would occur (full damage minus armor soak). - If B had a shield and had used Block instead of Evade, then upon a hit B would roll 2d10 with the shield’s modifier to try to nullify the blow entirely.
Weapons and Armor Classes
Avalore defines broad weapon classes with standardized stats. The simulator should model each weapon class so that any specific weapon (sword, axe, etc.) maps to one of these templates for mechanics. Key properties to represent: damage, attack action cost, range category, to-hit modifier, special traits (like AP), and stat requirements.
Below is a summary of weapons from the Weapons Index[29], divided by category:
Small Weapon: e.g. Daggers, short swords, knives. These are light one-handed weapons. Stats: Usually 1 action to attack, relatively low damage (~3 or 4), but easily concealable. One small weapon (or a meteor hammer, see below) can be carried additionally without counting toward the normal weapon carry limit[30] (so a character can have a “backup” dagger/meteor hammer aside from their main weapons). No strict stat requirement to use. Example: “Small blades” allow an armor-piercing strike via feat[25] and can be dual-wielded with the Dual Striker feat.
Arming Sword: Standard one-handed swords (arming swords, bastard swords used one-handed, jians, etc.)[20]. Stats: +1 to hit, 4 damage, 1 action to attack[20]. These are well-balanced weapons for beginners – accurate and moderate damage. Usually no special trait (no AP by default). Example: Longsword, cutlass, etc., would use these stats. Requirement: None or minimal (any character can use an arming sword effectively).
Finesse Blade: This likely covers rapiers, epees, sabers – one-handed swords emphasizing agility. (Not explicitly listed in the snippet, but referenced by feats and player profiles.) Stats: Presumably similar to arming swords in damage (~4) and action cost (1), but possibly a different bonus (perhaps +0 to hit, but maybe has an AP or crit advantage). The simulator can treat Finesse blades similarly to arming swords unless detailed info is found. Requirement: Possibly DEX or Finesse skill >= +1 to use effectively (given the name).
Mace: Heavy one-handed blunt weapons, also likely covering one-handed axes and flails[31]. Stats: Likely 5 damage, 1 action to swing (or possibly 2 actions if especially heavy). Maces might have no accuracy bonus (0 to hit) or even a -1 to hit (trading accuracy for damage). They excel against armor via brute force – the system might treat them as doing “GP” (general penetration) damage that is not reduced as much by armor. However, since armor soak is small random, we can instead say maces have no special AP but higher base damage. Requirement: Might require STR (e.g. STR: Athletics - no explicit snippet, but one could require at least average strength to wield heavy warhammers effectively).
Greatsword / Great Weapon: Two-handed swords, axes, great hammers. These are large melee weapons. Stats: Higher damage (possibly 6 or 7 damage), but require 2 actions to execute a swing[32] (so you can only attack once per turn with a greatsword). Likely no to-hit bonus or a small penalty because they are unwieldy. They might inherently have the Armor-Piercing trait due to their force, but the sources don’t state that; instead, a feat or special maneuver can grant AP. Requirement: High Strength (e.g. STR: Athletics +2 or +3 to use) – heavy weapons likely have stat prerequisites.
Polearm: Spears, halberds, poleaxes – two-handed weapons with reach. Stats: Similar to greatswords (high damage ~5-6, 2 actions per attack) but with extended range (skirmishing distance). Possibly a +0 to hit. Reach might allow certain advantages (attacking first as enemies approach or keeping distance). Requirement: Likely a STR or DEX threshold (balance of strength and skill).
Whip / Flail (Flexible weapons): Whips and chained weapons (like flails, meteor hammers) could be in their own category. Whips are one-handed skirmish weapons with long reach but low damage (maybe ~3 damage, 1 action, but can target from a short distance and possibly trip/disarm via feats). They likely have -1 to hit (whips are hard to use) and may be ineffective against armor (no AP, and perhaps armor gives extra protection). Meteor Hammer is a special case: a flexible weighted rope that can be used in one hand. It’s treated as a “small weapon” for carrying and dual-wielding purposes[30], but probably has reach. For simplicity, we can treat meteor hammer as a whip-like weapon: ~4 damage, 1 action. Requirement: Maybe DEX: Finesse +1 to handle.
Javelin: Thrown spears (without axe heads)[33]. Stats: Two-handed when thrown (you need both hands to heft and throw), can be used in melee as a spear. Perhaps 4 damage. Throwing a javelin might be 1 action (short range) and melee usage also 1 action. Javelins are versatile: can be used hand-to-hand or at range[34]. Requirement: None explicit, but STR: Athletics could help range.
Sling: Includes slings and hand crossbows (small projectile launchers)[21]. Stats: +1 to hit (they are easy to aim at short range), 6 damage, but require 2 actions (one to load/whirl, one to release)[21]. They are two-handed (you need both hands to spin a sling or load a hand crossbow)[21]. Range is skirmishing (not as far as a longbow, but further than melee). Requirement: none, but user must have both hands free while attacking.
Longbow: A powerful bow for long range. Stats: Likely 6 damage, 2 actions to fire (a heavy draw), and possibly a -1 to hit if unskilled (or no bonus). Cannot be used in heavy armor[35] (too cumbersome to draw in heavy gear). Very long range. Requirement: DEX and Strength combination (e.g. STR: Athletics +1 to draw). Longbows are ineffective underwater (cannot be used underwater at all).
Recurve Bow: A lighter bow (shortbow) for moderate range. Stats: Maybe 4 or 5 damage, 1 action to fire. Possibly +0 or +1 to hit (recurves are easier to handle than longbows). Also cannot be used in heavy armor[35]. Requirement: DEX: Finesse or Athletics - small requirement. Also not usable underwater.
Crossbow: (Not fully described in snippet, but implied.) Probably a two-handed ranged weapon with high damage and possibly AP. E.g., a crossbow might do 6 damage like a longbow, and perhaps requires 2 actions: one to load (cock) and one to shoot (which might be split across turns). Alternatively, treat it like the sling profile if hand crossbow is sling-equivalent and full crossbow is akin to a ranged heavy weapon. Crossbows work underwater (no range penalty)[14], giving them a unique niche. Requirement: Could be STR: Athletics +1 (to span the bow) or none if using a crannequin (but that costs actions).
Magical Foci: Wands, Spellbooks, Staves etc., used to channel spells. They are not exactly “weapons” but might allow a basic magical attack or simply serve as tools for casting. Wands and spellbooks are noted to function underwater (meaning a mage can cast spells underwater)[14]. The simulator can treat these as having no direct attack but being required for certain spellcasting.
Weapon Carry Limit: In Avalore, characters are limited in how many weapons they can carry ready. It appears one can carry two weapons (e.g. one main hand, one off-hand or backup) and additionally one small or flexible weapon for free[30]. A feat (“Mutant”) even allows carrying an extra weapon beyond this limit[36]. For simulation, you can allow each character to have up to 2 equipped weapons (or 1 weapon + 1 shield), plus one extra small weapon (like a dagger) if they have it. Trying to equip a third large weapon might be disallowed unless a special flag is set.
Armor Classes: Armor is categorized and imposes trade-offs between protection and mobility[2]: - Light Armor: e.g. padded cloth, leather. Effect: Reduces incoming damage by 1d2-1 (0 or 1 point)[22]. No agility penalty – ideal for high-dex characters. Requirement: very low (Dex: Acrobatics -1, essentially anyone can wear it)[37]. - Medium Armor: e.g. breastplate, half-plate. Effect: Reduces damage by 1d3-1 (0 to 2 points)[23]. Imposes -1 penalty on evasion rolls (slightly less nimble)[38]. Minimal stealth penalty compared to heavy. Requirement: moderate Strength (STR: Athletics +1)[39]. - Heavy Armor: e.g. full plate, chain mail. Effect: Reduces damage by 1d3 (1–3 points)[24] each hit. Significant mobility penalties: -1 block to movement actions (slower running)[13], -2 on all evasion rolls[15] (harder to dodge in armor), and -3 on stealth checks when moving (nearly impossible to be sneaky in clanky armor)[15]. Additionally, heavy armor prohibits use of longbows or recurve bows entirely[35]. Requirement: high Strength (STR: Athletics +3) to wear effectively[40]. - No Armor: A character with no armor gets no damage reduction, but has full mobility (and can fully benefit from high evasion, with no penalties).
The simulator should allow equipping one armor and enforce stat requirements and restrictions (e.g. if a character’s STR+Athletics sum is below requirement, they shouldn’t wear that armor). Penalties from armor (movement, evasion, stealth) should automatically apply in relevant calculations.
Shields: Treated separately from body armor: - Small Shield: A buckler or small round shield. Helps block damage (see Block mechanics above). Effect: If block roll succeeds, negates all damage. Small shields have a slightly harder block check (2d10-3 vs DC12)[27]. Requirement: DEX: Finesse +2 and STR: Athletics +2[41] (needs both agility and strength to use well). - Large Shield: A kite or tower shield. Block roll 2d10-2 vs DC12 (a bit easier)[42]. If blocking, it negates AP on incoming attacks (the shield’s size can even stop armor-piercing blows)[43]. Requirement: STR: Athletics +2 and STR: Fortitude +2[44] (strong arms and endurance to lug it). Large shields are heavy and typically preclude using a two-handed weapon.
Implement shield usage by allowing a character to hold a shield in off-hand. On their turn, they can activate “block” (perhaps a boolean state in the character object). Then on incoming attack resolution, if block is active and the character has a shield, perform the shield roll.
Feats and Special Abilities
Feats in Avalore are special traits or training that give characters new capabilities or bonuses. They often have stat prerequisites and are acquired via experience. The simulator doesn’t need to handle how they are acquired, but it should be able to model their effects if a character has them.
Some examples of normal feats and their effects: - Dual Striker: Allows dual-wielding two light weapons and attacking with both in one action. Effect: With two eligible one-handed weapons (e.g. any two of: small blades, arming swords, finesse blades, maces, whips, meteor hammer, or unarmed fists), the character can attack with both weapons as a single limited action[11]. Each attack roll gets a -1 aim penalty due to split focus[45]. Importantly, this dual-attack counts as one attack event for other mechanics (so if you hit a downed target with both, it triggers only one death save, and it only triggers one riposte opportunity, etc.)[46]. The feat likely requires moderate DEX and STR (e.g. Finesse +1 and Athletics +1) to learn. - Volley: Allows rapid bow shots. Effect: With a recurve bow or longbow, the character can fire two shots in the time of one attack. For a recurve bow, this consumes 1 action (since normally 1 action per shot), for a longbow 2 actions (normally 2 actions per shot) – essentially you get an extra arrow with your attack[47]. Each shot’s aim roll is at -1[47]. Can only be done once per turn[47]. This dramatically increases damage output for archers. Likely requires some DEX and maybe Perception skill. - Shieldmaster: (Inferred by references) Possibly grants bonuses to blocking or allows a shield bash. For instance, it might reduce the shield block penalty or allow a counter-attack. One feat description indicated certain limited actions “ignore bonuses from Shieldmaster and Quickfooted”[12], implying those feats give defensive bonuses normally. - Quickfooted: A feat name referenced (perhaps improves evasion or movement). It could give a permanent +1 to evasion rolls or extra movement. Some text suggests Quickfooted provides an evasion bonus that some attacks can ignore[12]. For example, an attacker’s special move might say it “ignores Quickfooted bonus” meaning Quickfooted likely gives +X to evasion or similar. - Precise Senses: Grants keen senses. The snippet suggests it negates certain penalties: “You incur no …” (likely no penalties in darkness or blindness)[48]. A character with this feat might ignore disadvantage or penalties when fighting in low light or against invisible targets, etc. - Second Wind (hypothetical name): There is a feat that allows a self-heal or temp HP: one feat allows “once per fight, use an action to gain temporary HP = STR: Fortitude + 2”[49]. This is akin to a second wind ability. The simulator can implement this by letting the character call that once and adding to HP (temporary HP could be tracked separately and removed first when taking damage). - Armor Piercer: A feat that lets normally non-AP weapons do an AP attack. The text: “When wielding an arming sword or small weapon, you can make an armour-piercing attack as a single limited action”[25]. If used, that attack ignores armor soak. If target has AP immunity (like a large shield user), it does +1 damage instead[25]. This likely has a STR 0 requirement, enabling even moderately strong characters to find weak spots. - Riposte: Likely allows a free counter-attack when you successfully evade or block. E.g. if an enemy misses you (or you evade successfully), you can use a reaction to immediately strike back. One feat mention: “You can make Riposte attacks with a -1 modifier if your evade failed or was a grazing hit…”[50], suggesting that even on a partial evade you still get to swing back. This encourages defensive fighters. Implementing riposte means after resolving an enemy’s attack, if conditions met, queue a counter-attack (outside the normal turn order). - Hindrances: These are negative traits (often taken as trade-offs for powerful feats or required for some character concepts). For example, Mutant feat grants extra carrying capacity but forces you to take a Hindrance[51]. Hindrances listed might include phobias, injuries, etc., which impose penalties. Example: “Phobia (Hemophobia)” – fear of blood – might cause penalties to Healing skill (as we saw an example character with Healing -1 perhaps due to this) or require a will check to act when someone is bleeding. Hindrances could also be things like Frail (lower max HP), Lame (-movement), etc. In the simulator, hindrances can be represented by simply adjusting the affected stats/skills or adding conditions (e.g. a “Phobia: blood” hindrance could trigger disadvantage on actions when blood is present; implementing that might be complex, so it could be omitted unless needed).
Feats in general will require custom logic in the simulator. A design approach: - Feat Data: Define each feat in a data structure with: name, requirements, and an apply_effect hook or flags for what it modifies (e.g. {'name': 'Dual Striker', 'on_attack': function(...), 'limited_action': True} etc.). - During Simulation: Check each character’s feats at relevant times. For instance, when an attack action is declared, check if the character has Dual Striker and is using two weapons – allow a dual attack sequence. When calculating evasion, check for Quickfooted feat to add a bonus. When ending a turn, check if any once-per-turn feats (like volley) were used, to enforce limits.
For initial implementation, you might hard-code a few key feats and their effects, and expand as needed.
Magic and Arcane Mechanics
Magic in Avalore is a separate system with its own resource called Anima. The simulator’s focus is combat, but if spells are involved, you should handle casting rolls and spell effects. Key points from the Arcane mechanics[5][52]:
Anima Pool: Mages have an Anima value representing how much magical energy they can use per day[52]. For example, a Mage I has 8 Anima points[53]. Casting a spell consumes a certain amount of Anima. The simulator should track each character’s current Anima (if they can cast spells) and not allow spells if insufficient Anima remains (unless overcasting, see below).
Spells and Disciplines: Spells are categorized into six disciplines (Ichor, Cursesmithy, Ether, Artifice, Force, Tellurgy)[54][55]. Each spell has an Anima cost, a casting method (verbal, somatic gestures, etc.), and a casting time (number of actions)[52]. These details would come from the Grimoire. For simulation, you can create a small sample spell list if needed (e.g. a firebolt spell costing 2 Anima, 1 action to cast, does 5 fire damage at range).
Casting Roll: To cast a spell (other than trivial cantrips), the caster must succeed on a casting roll: roll 2d10 + HAR: Arcana skill vs DC 10[5]. Magic is slightly easier to succeed than normal tasks (DC 10 instead of 12)[5].
If the roll is 10 or higher, the spell succeeds and its effects occur[56].
If the roll is below 10, the spell miscasts – it fails, and half of the Anima cost is still lost with no effect[56]. Some spells might have additional mishap effects on a miscast (the Grimoire entry for the spell would note if so)[57].
This roll is made when the casting begins (on the first action used for the spell)[58]. If a spell takes multiple actions to cast and the roll fails at the start, the caster wastes that initial action and the spell fizzles.
Overcasting: If a caster is out of Anima but desperately needs to cast, they can attempt to overcast a spell they know (only if their max Anima would normally be enough for it)[59]:
The casting roll is made as usual. If the spell succeeds, it works, but the caster immediately suffers a backlash: roll 1d6 and consult consequences[60]. Consequences range from severe (1-2 on the d6, e.g. permanent scarring or being knocked down with fatigue)[61] to mild (5-6, e.g. ringing ears or numb hands)[62]. The simulator can either implement a lookup for these or simply flag that a consequence happened.
If the overcast miscasts (fail <10), the caster is knocked unconscious and their Anima pool drops to 0[63]. Essentially, they burn out completely. This is a risky move.
A character can overcast at most once per day[64] (the simulator can have a flag to prevent multiple overcasts).
Patrons & Restrictions: Only characters who have formed a Pact with a Patron can use magic. In practice, you might just designate in the character data whether someone is a mage and their Anima/known spells. Patrons also determine a mage’s primary discipline (granting +1 casting bonus for that school and forbidding the opposite school’s spells)[65], and limit how many spells they can know at each “Mage level”[53]. These details are mostly meta; for simulation, ensure a mage character has a list of spells they can cast and maybe a discipline for bonus calculation.
Spell Effects: When a spell succeeds, apply its effect. This could be damage, healing, a buff, etc. A few examples (to illustrate implementation):
A Force Bolt (Force discipline spell) might cost 1 Anima, cast in 1 action, require a ranged attack roll or just hit, dealing ~4 damage and pushing the target (Force spells often move things).
A Healing Spell (Ichor discipline) might cost 2 Anima, take 1 action, and heal an ally 5 HP on success.
A Curse (Cursesmithy) might inflict a debuff, requiring the target to fail a contest (the system mentions spells that force STR: Fortitude or DEX: Acrobatics saves to resist[66]).
Balance note: Offensive spells might require the target to roll a defense (like a saving throw). For simplicity, treat damaging spells as either auto-hit on cast success or as requiring the target to make an opposed roll (which could be built similarly to evasion or a stat check).
When coding, treat spells similarly to attacks but with the casting roll in place of an attack roll: - Deduct Anima cost when cast. - If casting roll fails, handle miscast (refund half cost, no effect). - If succeeds, either apply effect directly or prompt target to roll a save depending on spell type. - Include any damage or healing in the combat log.
Backend Design Suggestions
With the mechanics detailed above, here are recommendations for structuring a Python backend to simulate Avalore combat between two characters:
1. Data Models (Classes or Data Structures): - Character Class: Represent each character with attributes: - Stats: dex, int, har, str (integers -3 to +3). - Skills: perhaps a dict of skill values, e.g. skills = {'Acrobatics':0, 'Stealth':0, ...}. - Combat attributes: hp (starting 20), anima (if mage, else 0), armor (link to an Armor object), shield (link or None), weapon_main and weapon_off (link to Weapon objects, off-hand could be None if not dual-wield). - Derived mods: Could calculate evasion = dex + Acrobatics + armor_evasion_penalty, etc., or compute on the fly. - Feats: list of feat names/IDs the character has. - State flags: is_evading (True if Evade action used and not yet next turn), is_blocking (True if Block used with shield up). - Weapon Class: Store weapon stats: - Name, damage, to_hit_bonus, actions_required, range_category ('melee'/'skirmish'/'ranged'), is_two_handed (bool), armor_piercing (bool), allowed_in_heavy (bool), etc. - Stat requirement (perhaps store as a tuple like ('STR','Athletics',1) meaning STR+Ath >=1). - Armor Class: Store armor type: - Name, soak_dice (e.g. (1,2) for 1d2-1: could store formula or function), evasion_penalty, stealth_penalty, move_penalty, heavy (bool). - Stat requirement tuple. - Shield Class: Store shield properties: - Name, block_modifier (e.g. -3), vsRanged_bonus (+1 for all shields), grants_AP_immunity (True for large shield), stat requirement. - Feat definitions: Could be a simple dictionary of feat effects or a Feat class. For each feat, note what it modifies: - E.g. Dual Striker: feat_dual_striker(attacker) could be a function that splits attack. - Evasion bonus feats (Quickfooted): could add to evasion calculation. - Riposte: flagged in character to allow reaction attack when conditions met. - Alternatively, implement a method for each phase (pre-attack, post-attack) to check feats.
2. Turn Simulation Logic: - For a simple two-character duel, alternate turns. On each turn, reset the character’s is_evading/is_blocking from last turn (they last only until turn start). Let the AI or user decide actions. - Action decision can be hardcoded or random for now: e.g., if enemy is in range, decide to Attack; if HP low, maybe Evade; if have shield, occasionally Block; if mage and have spells, maybe cast a spell, etc. - Performing Actions: Implement functions for each action: - perform_attack(attacker, defender, weapon, is_dual_strike=False): Handles the attack resolution as per rules (including checking defender’s evade/block states, rolling attack, applying damage). If is_dual_strike true, handle two weapons in one go (two attack rolls, each at -1, and aggregate outcomes). - perform_evade(character): Sets character.is_evading = True and consumes an action. - perform_block(character): Sets character.is_blocking = True (if character has a shield) and consumes an action. - perform_cast(caster, spell, target): Handles spellcasting rolls, Anima reduction, and either calls a spell effect function or returns an outcome. - perform_move(character, distance): Could adjust positions if simulating positions. If not using a grid, can ignore except for noting distance for range. - use_feat(character, feat_name): For feats that use an action (like Second Wind for temp HP), implement effect. - Each action reduces the available action count. When actions = 0 or character is done, end turn, then enemy turn.
3. Dice Rolling Utility: Use Python’s random.randint or random.choices to simulate 2d10, 1d3, etc. For example, roll_2d10() returning an int 2-20, and perhaps a function for armor soak (taking an Armor object and returning the soak roll result).
4. Feat Handling: One approach is to incorporate feat effects into the above action functions: - When calculating an attack roll, check attacker’s feats for things like Precise Aim (+1 in certain conditions) or Dual Striker (if this is a dual attack scenario). - When calculating evasion, check defender’s feats for bonuses (Quickfooted might add +3 vs certain weapon types[67] – the snippet suggests Quickfooted or another feat gave +3 evasion vs specific attacks like maces, greatswords, etc.). - At the end of an enemy’s attack, if defender has Riposte and the attack missed or was dodged, allow a bonus attack back. - Use flags or properties in Character like character.limited_action_used to ensure feats like Volley (once per turn) are not spammed.
5. Ensuring Rules Integrity: Incorporate the restrictions: - If a character in heavy armor tries to use a longbow, block that action (print a message like "Too encumbered to use this weapon"). - If carrying too many weapons, possibly disallow switching to a third (though for two characters, this might not come up much). - Enforce stat requirements on equip: e.g. if STR+Athletics is below heavy armor’s requirement, you could either prevent equipping or impose the penalties more severely (Avalore would normally just not allow it). Safer to prevent equipping in the simulator.
6. Logging/Output: Since this is a simulator, create a clear log of events for each turn. E.g.:
Attacker rolls 2d10=14, +1 sword bonus = 15 vs DC12: hit. Defender in medium armor (soak roll 1d3-1 = 2), damage 4-2 = 2. Defender HP 18/20.
This will help verify the mechanics.
7. Example Workflow (Putting it together): - Initialize characters (choose stats, equip items, assign feats). - Initiative: maybe roll 2d10 + DEX to see who starts. - Loop rounds until one drops: - Character A’s turn: decide on actions (for testing, perhaps always attack twice if able, or attack + evade, etc.). - Resolve each action with the above functions (account for limited action feats if used). - Character B’s turn: similarly decide actions. - Check end conditions (HP <= 0 => someone down).
By following the above structure, the Python backend can simulate a fight adhering to Avalore’s rules. The key is modularity: separate concerns for rolling, applying armor, checking feats, so that each piece of the mechanics can be adjusted or expanded (for example, adding more feats or spells easily, or adjusting for multiple combatants beyond two). The citations provided correspond to the official Avalore mechanics descriptions to verify each rule implemented[1][5][13][20]. With this foundation, one can iteratively refine the simulator and even build a simple text-based interface or AI to choose actions for the characters.
